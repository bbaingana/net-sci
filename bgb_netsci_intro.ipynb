        "# Complex networks\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Networks are an ubiquitous phenomenon. They underlie most complex systems that we often take for granted. One of the foremost intellectual challenges of the 21st century is to understand the structure underlying complex systems; networks provide such a framework for abstracting complexity. Complex systems arise in both natural and engineered settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Obvious examples include the Internet, the world-wide web, and online social networks, for example, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter.This class of systems also encompasses power grids, communications networks, transport networks, and supply chain networks. Less obvious examples can be found in brain connectivity networks, disease transmission networks, and gene regulatory networks. \n",
        "\n",
        "On a fundamental level, a network is a flexible, general-purpose data structure that encodes pairwise interactions between constituent components of a system. For example, in a friendship network like Facebook, the components (a.k.a., nodes) are people, and a link exists between pairs of friends. Similarly, the world-wide web comprises web pages as nodes, and a link is established between pages if one page has a web link to another page.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Fundamentals\n",
        "\n",
        "__What is a network__? Put simply, a network can be defined as a _collection of interconnected things_. The key emphasis here should be on _\"things\"_ and _\"interconnected\"_:\n",
        "\n",
        "-  In the context of a social network, things are humans, and interconnectedness captures friendships.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In an electrical circuit, things are active and passive components e.g., resistors, capacitors, etc. The connections are phyical wires/conductors between the circuit components. \n",
        "\n",
        "- In communication networks, things are transmitters and receivers of signals, while interconnectedness is encoded in the communication links. \n",
        "\n",
        "More technically, things are termed as __nodes__ or __vertices__, while the connections are termed as __links__, or __edges__. It is crucial to point out that understanding complex systems is tantamount to understanding the behavior of their underlying networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Networks have a long history, starting with Leonhard Euler's eighteenth century work on graph theory. In subsequent years, various disciplines studied domain-specific networks, for example, circuit theory and power grids in electrical engineering, molecular structure in chemistry, social network analysis or sociometrics, ecology, genetic inheritence, telecom networks and the Internet, to name a few.\n",
        "\n",
        "Studying networks outside their application domains was a relatively insignificant endeavor until the last couple of decades. From the mid 1990s, network science as we know it blossomed into a major area of scientific research. A few reasons can be attributed to this change.\n",
        "\n",
        "Firstly, the emergence of the world-wide web coupled with commercialization of web applications whose business models capitalized on understanding the structure of the web. The wild success of companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter is a testament to the inherent value in understanding complex networks of human interactions. Furthermore, this interest was ignited by the ease of collection and storage of data from the web, as well as the availability of cheap computing resources to manage large-scale network analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Secondly, globalization has been heralded as a marvel of the 20th century. With globalization, our world became so interconnected that a volcanic eruption in Iceland can impact flight patterns in Los Angeles, an epidemic in one corner of the world can quickly engulf the planet, and lead to untold economic and health hazards. Recruitment of terrorists into terrorist networks has never been easier, thanks to global connectivity. For this reason, there has been ample scientific and government interest to fund research gearedv towards understanding the properties of complex networks, especially those responsible for spread of diseases, emergence of terrorist cells, and global finance, to name a few.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, science appears to have hit a wall with a focus on reductionism. Historically, it has been the case that a fundamental understanding of the universe entails mapping the behavior of the most fundamental particles in Physics. However, there has been a growing realization that complex behavior can emerge out of simple entities with minimal capabilities, but connected to one another in a web of links. Classic examples include flocks of thousands of birds, or schools of fish that behave in unison to evade prey, without instruction of a single leader.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Network science: A new science?\n",
        "\n",
        "Over the last few years, a new field of study, aptly named __Network Science__ has emerged to consolidate intellectual endeavors pertaining to the study of complex systems and their underlying networks. The key premise of network science is that despite the diversity of complex systems, the behavior of their underlying networks is driven by a common set of mathematical laws. As a result, network science provides a universal language for describing complexity, and encompasses the study of systems from biology to sociology.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The impact of network science\n",
        "\n",
        "The impact of network science cannot be understated:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Social networks have become interwoven into the fabric of modern life.\n",
        "- Modern urban and rural infrastructure depends on understanding the complexity embedded in transportation networks.\n",
        "- Epidemiological studies and efforts to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases rely on a mathematical understanding of the propagation of phenomena over complex human networks.\n",
        "- Modern services like Google web search, Cisco network routing, Facebook, Instgram, etc., all rely on a concrete understading of networks and network data.\n",
        "- Efforts to map the entire human brain, and to understand its behavior rely on a universal set of principles developed under the network science umbrella.\n",
        "- Understated security successes e.g., the capture of Saddam Hussein depended upon critical analysis of networks of human contacts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why study network science?\n",
        "\n",
        "Network science addresses a number of theoretical and practical questions arising in complex systems. The list below is not exhaustive, but it is quite representative of contemporary issues:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Network science tools can reveal statistical patterns and properties of data arising from networks. For example, understanding typical clusters that emerge from a social network is crucial to detect anaomalous behavior due to e.g., financial fraud.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Network science studies aspire to develop universal theories about networks; that knowledge can (hopefully) be transferred to understanding networks whose data are not readily available. For example, the conclusions drawn from the structure of the world-wide web, may be useful in understanding or predicting neuronal networks, whose data is much more expensive and time-consuming to acquire, and process.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Network science can facilitate the design and engineering of robust, resilient, and resource-efficient networks. Engineering objectives such as design of transportation networks that route traffic faster, or communication networks that are self-healing are well-served by a solid scientific understanding of network behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Contemporary network science themes\n",
        "\n",
        "To date, network science has focused on the following research themes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Empirical characterization of networks and the data that propagates over them. This encompasses approches to sample data from networks, leverage statistics to estimate network measures, and effectively visualize complex networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Development of mathematical models capable of abstractinng networks. Using the established fields of graph theory and statsitical inference, network science studies focus on developing robust models for the emergence and evolution of networks. Such models are useful to simulate and predict network behavior, but also to detect anomalies in networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Statistical learning from networks. Modern machine learning (ML) assumes the presence of well-structured data, typically provided in arrays or matrices of data. Networks on the other hand provide a more general abstraction of data that encompasses traditional tabular structures, but also arbitrary connections captured through network links. Extending the capabilities of ML models to \"understand\" network data is one of the contemporary endeavors of network science practitioners.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Examples of complex networks\n",
        "\n",
        "As alluded to earlier, networks arise in so many domains. Here we provide some examples classified under a few broad themes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- __Technological networks__ include transportation networks (roads, railways, airport networks), communication networks (the Internet, cellular networks), power distribution networks, sensor networks. A few questions that can be addressed by network science include: What is the extent of the Internet? How can changes to a road network impact travel times? Which routers are critical to the flow of information? Which airports serve as the main hubs for domestic travel in the US?\n",
        "\n",
        "- __Biological networks__ include gene regulatory networks, protein interaction networks, neuronal structure in the brain, metabolic pathways, predator-prey interaction networks, and ecological networks. Common questions one can answer include: Which gene interactions are most frequent? Which regions of interest (ROI) in the brain are critical for motor functions? Which proteins are most critical to body metabolism?\n",
        "\n",
        "- __Social networks__ include friendship networks (e.g., Facebook), email exchange networks, financial transaction networks, online dating networks, etc. Questions include: What natural communities emerge from the social networks? Which individuals are the most popular in the network? Which individuals act as bridges between otherwise disjoint clusters?\n",
        "\n",
        "- __Information networks__ include the world-wide web (WWW), Twitter, co-citation networks between academic journals, paper co-authorship networks, the network of blogs (a.k.a., the blogosphere). Some questions that a network analyst might seek to answer include: How does the WWW structure evolve with time? Can the propagation of information in online networks be characterized and predicted?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "In this article, we have motivated the need to understand networks as a powerful tool for abstracting complex systems. We also introduced the network science subjects, as well as some of the topics the field studies. Finally, we gave a few examples of networks arising in different domains, along with examples of questions that network science can address.\n",
